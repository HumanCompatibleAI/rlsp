# Reward Learning by Simulating the Past

This is the code accompanying the paper "Preferences Implicit in the State of the World".

Tests can be run with `python setup.py test`.

Instructions for running the experiments can be found in `experiments.sh`. The script `experiments-for-plots.sh` generates the plots from the paper.
